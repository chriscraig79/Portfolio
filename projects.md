Through customer interviews and workshops, I gathered direct insights from users, uncovering the key challenges faced by whistleblowers and the organisations managing their reports.

## Whistleblower Challenges
Whistleblowers often fear retaliation or exposure, which discourages them from reporting issues. They also experience frustration due to a lack of updates or the inability to provide further details and still remain anonymous, making the process feel ineffective. Additionally, they are concerned about the security of their reports and personal information. Language barriers and accessibility challenges further hinder reproting.

## Organisational Challenges
Organisations, on the other hand, struggle to act on suspected wrongdoing when they lack sufficient evidence or cannot contact whistleblowers for for further information. They face pressure to meet regulatory compliance standards to avoid penalties. Managing whistleblowing reports is often complex and time-consuming, leading to delays in addressing issues. Moreover, limited information restricts their ability to proactively manage risks.

## Concept Validation
Building on this research, I created a high-level sequences diagram to get feedback and validate an initial concept for a confidential reporting system acting as a proxy between the Whistleblower and the management system. The flow outlines how reports submitted are handled securely by multilpe users throughout the process.

## UX Devlopment
The flow is designed to reduce barriers to reporting, ensuring users feel safe and supported throughout, addressing key need such as maintaining anonymity, enabling secure communication and supporting efficient triage and investigation workflows.

### Mobile Interface Examples
Research indicated that reporters are more likely to use their personal mobile device to submit a report, away from their work laptop or device.

This research provided the foundation for developing a whistleblowing system that protects vulnerable reporters while enabling effective organisational compliance and investigation processes.

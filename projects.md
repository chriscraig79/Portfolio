Through customer interviews and workshops, I gathered direct insights from users, uncovering the key challenges faced by whistleblowers and the organisations managing their reports.

## Whistleblower Challenges
Whistleblowers often fear retaliation or exposure, which discourages them from reporting issues. They also experience frustration due to a lack of updates or the inability to provide further details and remain anonymous, making the process feel ineffective. Additionally, they are concerned about the security of their reports and personal information. Language barriers and accessibility challenges further hinder their ability to report concerns.

## Organisational Challenges
Organisations, on the other hand, struggle to act on suspected wrongdoing when they lack sufficient evidence or cannot contact whistleblowers for clarification. They face pressure to meet regulatory and industry compliance standards to avoid penalties and require a scalable whistleblowing mechanism to grow with the organisation. Managing whistleblowing reports is often complex and time-consuming, leading to delays in addressing issues. Moreover, limited information restricts their ability to proactively manage risks.

## Concept Validation
Building on our research, I produced a high-level sequences diagram to validate the initial concept for a confidential reporting system acting as a proxy between the Whistleblower and the application. The flow outlines how reports submitted by whistleblowers are handled securely and anonymously by various users through the process.

## UX Concept
The concept outlines a secure and user-friendly process for whistleblowers to report concerns while maintaining their anonymity. The flow is designed to reduce barriers to reporting, ensuring users feel safe and supported throughout, ensuring the key needs are addressed, such as maintaining anonymity, enabling secure communication, and supporting efficient triage and investigation workflows.

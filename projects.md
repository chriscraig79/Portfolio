Through customer interviews and workshops, I gathered direct insights from users, uncovering the key challenges faced by whistleblowers and the organisations managing their reports. Strong interest from both existing customers and prospects has further highlighted the importance and urgency of addressing these issues.

## Whistleblower Challenges

Whistleblowers often fear retaliation or exposure, which discourages them from reporting issues. They also experience frustration due to a lack of updates or the inability to provide further details and remain anonymous, making the process feel ineffective. Additionally, they are concerned about the security of their reports and personal information. Language barriers and accessibility challenges further hinder their ability to report concerns.

## Organisational Challenges

Organisations, on the other hand, struggle to act on suspected wrongdoing when they lack sufficient evidence or cannot contact whistleblowers for clarification. They face pressure to meet regulatory and industry compliance standards to avoid penalties and require a scalable whistleblowing mechanism to grow with the organisation. Managing whistleblowing reports is often complex and time-consuming, leading to delays in addressing issues. Moreover, limited access to data and insights restricts their ability to proactively manage risks.

## Concept Validation

Building on our research, we developed a high-level process flow to validate the initial concept for a confidential reporting system acting as a proxy between the Whistleblower and the Clue application. This flow outlines how reports submitted by whistleblowers are handled securely and anonymously by various users through the process.

The goal was to ensure the concept addresses key user needs, such as maintaining anonymity, enabling secure communication, and supporting efficient triage and investigation workflows. By mapping out this process, we could identify potential challenges, validate assumptions, and refine the design to ensure it meets both user expectations and organisational requirements.

This research provided the foundation for developing a whistleblowing system that protects vulnerable reporters while enabling effective organizational compliance and investigation processes.

Problem solving drives me. Great design starts with deeply understanding the problem and who it belongs to. 

Whether mapping user journeys, developing concepts, or running usability tests, my aim is empathy for users paired with data insights and alignment with business needs.

I've embraced AI in my daily workflow for everything from research to prototyping. This empowers me to go further and simulate real-world use cases and scenarios, generating more insightful feedback.

I'm also exploring AI generative coding tools such as Claude Code, Figma Make, and Lovable, and the transformative impact they will undoubtedly have. As a generalist, the potential this offers me is exciting, where I was once constrained by my coding skills, I'm now able to build not only prototypes but real applications, and surprisingly quicker. 

I'm optimistically hopeful that AI's impact on web design and development will be a positive one, removing the mundane and repetitive activities rather than replacing humans altogether.

Prototyping in the browser is my preferred approach as it fosters tighter collaboration with developers, surfaces issues earlier in the process, and enables me to bake accessibility and responsiveness into every component from the outset. 

Iâ€™m equally adept with Figma having introduced and maintained design systems across multiple projects and organisations to drive consistency and scalability from early wireframes through to production-ready code.

Problem solving drives me. Great design always starts with deeply understanding the problem and whom it belongs to. 

Whether mapping user journeys, developing concepts, or running usability tests, my aim is empathy for users paired with data insights and alignment with business needs.

I've embraced AI in my daily workflow for everything from research to prototype generation. This empowers me to go further and simulate real-world use cases and scenarios, and even generating production-ready JavaScript that once required developer support.

Prototyping in the browser is my preferred approach as it fosters tighter collaboration with developers, surfaces issues earlier in the process, and enables me to bake accessibility and responsiveness into every component from the outset. 

Iâ€™m equally adept with Figma having introduced and maintained design systems across multiple projects and organisations to drive consistency and scalability from early wireframes through to production-ready code.
